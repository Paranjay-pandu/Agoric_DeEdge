# DeEdge :  A Decentralized Subscription-Based Content ManagementÂ Platform

The platform features a modern, visually appealing interface with smooth transitions, a blockchain-inspired color theme, and robust functionalities for managing NFTs.

The platform is built using **Agoric**, a framework for building secure smart contracts and decentralized applications. Agoric allows us to implement blockchain-based features like NFTs with minimal risk, leveraging secure JavaScript-based smart contracts.

- **NFT Management**: View, manage, and explore NFTs stored on the blockchain.
- **Responsive Design**: The platform is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Blockchain Theme**: The UI is designed with a blockchain-inspired color scheme, using gradients and vibrant colors like aqua, violet, and indigo.
- **Agoric Integration**: Utilizes Agoric's secure smart contracts to manage blockchain interactions.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React-Bootstrap**: A React component library that implements the Bootstrap framework for UI elements.
- **React Icons**: Used for adding icons to the UI for a better visual experience.
- **CSS**: Custom CSS for styling and layout adjustments.
